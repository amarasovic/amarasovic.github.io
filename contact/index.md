If you're interested in doing a PhD in the School of Computing, *please apply*. We will carefully consider every application. More information about the application process can be found [here](https://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/admissions/).

<summary markdown="span" style="color:orange"><b>Note on the Statement of Purpose</b> [Click to expand!]</summary>              


Through the years I noticed that many students believe they should focus on maximizing the number of publications to improve their PhD application. While demonstrating _research_ experience and skills is indeed _very_ important, this comes in different flavors. Publishing is one. Others include good scientific writing, developed research taste, knowledge of currently most prominent approaches in the area of interest and the gaps that need to be filled in to make short- and long-term progress, ideas of how to address these gaps, etc. Just as publishing, these are acquired skills that we do _not_ expect that you already _fully mastered_ when applying for PhD. That's what a PhD is for. ðŸ™‚ Your statement is your chance to demonstrate to a potential advisor, who doesn't know you yet, that you are capable and excited to further develop these skills. I hope you can infer now how even research projects and activities that did not result in a publication can be useful in your statement. I linked some resources for how to improve these skills [here](https://www.anamarasovic.com/mentoring/). There you can also find examples of great statements as well as advices.

While I'm flattered to be considered as anyone's advisor, as most professors I don't have bandwidth to answer generic emails that inform me about your achivements and that you are interested in working with me. In very rare cases, when those emails are specific and truly relevant for my ongoing research and interests, I respond. If I haven't responded to you, sending more emails won't help.
