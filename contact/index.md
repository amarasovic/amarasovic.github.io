<span style="color:#f58d42;">_I am **not** hiring PhD students in the 2023/2024 application cycle!_</span>

Please address me as Professor, Professor MarasoviÄ‡, Dr MarasoviÄ‡, or Ana if we are on a first-name basis (please feel free to ask if unsure). My pronouns are she/her. 

My name is pronounced as Ah-nah Mara-so-veetch, with "Mara" as the actress "Mara Wilson".

The first semester working together would be an unpaid/independent study. If things are going well and there is continued mutual interest in working together, Iâ€™m open to helping you with the [UROP proposal](https://our.utah.edu/research-scholarship-opportunities/urop/) if youâ€™re a BS student or taking you as an RA if youâ€™re a MS student. **This is not guaranteed!** Only after working together we can have a conversation about it, especially for RA-ships that are subject to my current funding abilities.

If you're interested in doing a PhD in the School of Computing, *please apply*. We will carefully consider every application. More information about the application process can be found [here](https://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/admissions/).

While I'm honored to be considered as anyone's advisor, as most professors I don't have bandwidth to answer every email that inform me about achivements and interest to work with me. In _very rare cases_, when an email is specific and demonstrates that the writer genuinely engaged with my work, I might respond. If I haven't responded to you, not only that sending more emails won't help, it actually overwhelms me, and I'd really appreciate if you don't do that.

<summary markdown="span" style="color:orange"><b>Note on the Statement of Purpose</b> [Click to expand!]</summary>              


Through the years I noticed that many students believe they should focus on maximizing the number of publications to improve their PhD application. While demonstrating _research_ experience is indeed _very_ important, it is not all that matters. I strongly recommend reading "[Inside Ph.D. admissions: What readers look for in a Statement of Purpose](https://nschneid.medium.com/inside-ph-d-admissions-what-readers-look-for-in-a-statement-of-purpose-3db4e6081f80)" by Nathan Schneider. 

You can have a great record, but you also must demonstrate good focus and fit. A statement with well-written focus and fit shows developed research taste, knowledge of currently most prominent approaches in the area of interest and the gaps that need to be filled in to make short- and long-term progress, ideas of how to address these gaps, why working with some advisor in some school will help you tackle these questions, etc. Just as publishing, some of these are acquired skills that we do _not_ expect that you already _fully mastered_ when applying for PhD. That's what a PhD is for. ðŸ™‚ Your statement is your chance to demonstrate to a potential advisor, who doesn't know you yet, that you figured this out to _some extent_. A great record without showing any of these does not make an application I'd be excited about. 

I hope you can infer now how even research projects and activities that did not result in a publication can be useful in your statement. I linked some resources for how to improve these skills [here](https://www.anamarasovic.com/mentoring/), and you can find examples of great statements [here](https://cs-sop.org/).
