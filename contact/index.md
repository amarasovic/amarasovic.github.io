### You are *not* a student at the University of Utah, but you hope to be

If you're interested in doing a PhD in the School of Computing, *please apply*. We will carefully consider every application. More information about the application process can be found [here](https://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/admissions/).

**Suggestions for the Statement of Purpose**

Through the years I noticed that it's a common assumption among students that maximizing the number of published paper is the most important thing in their PhD application. 
While demonstrating _research_ experience and skills is indeed _very_ important, this comes in different flavors. 
Publishing is one. 


**Why didn't I answer your email?** 

I fully agree with everything Yonatan Bisk wrote under "Information about Emailing Professors/Why is your email being ignored" available [here](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html).
