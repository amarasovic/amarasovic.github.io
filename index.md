I am an Assistant Professor in the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). My primary research interests are at the confluence of **natural language processing (NLP)**, **explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)**, and **multimodality**. I am interested in projects that (1) **rigorously validate** AI technologies, and (2) make human **interaction** with AI **more intuitive**. 

For an example of robust validation check out our work on carefully designing benchmarks to validate robustness of QA models in the presence of common linguistic phenomena such as [negation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00295) or [coreference](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1606/). On the other hand, to help people create a mental model about how to interact with AI, I have contributed to building models that self-explain their predictions in a way that is easily understandable to people. For example by saying why did the model give this answer instead of another one ([contrastive explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13985)) or by telling in plain language the gist of its reasoning ([free-text explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08284)). Moving forward, I am excited to evaluate and improve such models with application-grounded, human-subject evaluations.                     

Previously, I was a Young Investigator at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) from 2019--2022 where I worked  with [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). During that time I also had a courtesy appointment in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I did my PhD in the [Heidelberg University NLP Group](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/nlpgroup/), where I was advised by [Anette Frank](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~frank/). Prior to receiving my PhD in 2019, I completed B.Sc. (2013) and M.Sc. (2015) in Mathematics at the University of Zagreb. 


I grew up in [OmiÅ¡, Croatia](https://youtu.be/Cnrjm-Le_vw). One would think I was always appreciative of mountains living in a place like that, but it took moving to Seattle to realize that free time is best spent outdoors.
