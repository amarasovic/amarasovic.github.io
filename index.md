I'm an assistant professor in the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). My research interests  broadly fall into **NLP**, **human-centered AI**, and **intrepretability**. The problems I'm currently most excited about are: 

* Empowering individuals and groups by improving their **AI-assisted** _decision making_, _communication_, and _creativity_ in real-world applications.             
* Radically changing **evaluation protocols** for **studying human behavior** under AI assistance.                  
* Creating new **high-quality training** and **evaluation data** and understanding **the role of professional** dataset creators, domain experts, and annotators in this process in the era of generative AI.    
* Connecting explanations generated in **plain language** with **internal computations**.                    

Previously, I was a Young Investigator at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) (2019--2022), working with [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), and held a courtesy appointment in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I earned my PhD from the [Heidelberg University NLP Group](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/nlpgroup/), where I was advised by [Anette Frank](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~frank/). Prior to receiving my PhD in 2019, I completed B.Sc. (2013) and M.Sc. (2015) in Mathematics at the University of Zagreb. 


I grew up in [OmiÅ¡, Croatia](https://youtu.be/Cnrjm-Le_vw). One would think I was always appreciative of mountains living in a place like that, but it took moving to Seattle to realize that free time is best spent outdoors.
