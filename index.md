I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah. My primary research interests are at the confluence of **natural language processing (NLP)**, **explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)**, and **multimodality**. I am interested in projects that **rigorously validate** AI technologies and projects that make human **interaction** with AI **more intuitive**. As an example of the former you can see our work on carefully designing benchmarks to validate robustness of question answering models in the presence of common linguistic phenomena such as [coreference](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1606/).                    

Previously, I was a Young Investigator at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) where I worked  with [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). During that time I also had a courtesy appointment in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). I did my PhD in the [Heidelberg University NLP Group](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/nlpgroup/), where I was advised by [Anette Frank](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~frank/). Prior to receiving my PhD in 2019, I completed B.Sc. (2013) and M.Sc. (2015) in **Mathematics** at the University of Zagreb. I grew up in [Omi≈°, Croatia](https://youtu.be/Cnrjm-Le_vw).
