A rare opportunity: *ACL conference in my homeland! Of course, I had to combine it with a visit to my family in [Omi≈°](https://goo.gl/maps/bw4jJHUMDVS1cf4q9?coh=178571&entry=tt), and what better way than by bike? üòÅ

## Before the ride: Dubrovnik / EACL conferance

This was my first time bringing a bike on a plane, and disassembling was easier than expected. I followed [this video](https://youtu.be/LZQoKNCjAhY) recommended by a friend and borrowed his bike travel bag. The only thing that went wrong was that I didn‚Äôt put a spacer between the brake pads and, of course, the brakes closed. I pushed apart the pistons and tried to adjust the space with the lever, but my front brake was still barely workable. Oh well. 

The conference's highlights were sunsets, beautiful old Dubrovnik town, and the conference cat! üòª

On the last day, we put our stuff and bike cases on a bus that goes through Omi≈° and arranged with the driver that my dad picks them up. Perks of biking in Croatia!

## NP Mljet 

Lucy and I originally planned to bike to Dubrovnik ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Ston](https://goo.gl/maps/VRoYQYeoU49CrqZHA?coh=178571&entry=tt) ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Prapratno](https://goo.gl/maps/hLLPvxirBK2XbZBF7?coh=178571&entry=tt) [36 mi / 3431ft el. gain], then take a ferry to [Sobra](https://goo.gl/maps/MTJq9n3MwV9ZyUBM9?coh=178571&entry=tt) and bike to NP Mljet [another 20mi / 2000ft el. gain]. Then we would eventually return to Prapratno and bike to [Korƒçula Town](https://goo.gl/maps/xCa97W9475GLVXYN6?coh=178571&entry=tt) and that day would take 64mi / 6300ft el. gain.  

However, as the trip approached, the SLC winter storms were not stopping and I was super undertrained. So, we decided to take a catamaran to NP Mljet and spend a day there biking with another friend, and go to Korƒçula by catamaran. 

Biking in the park was very relaxing.
